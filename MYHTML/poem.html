<p> Cristiano Ronaldo,<br>
    He goes by the name CR7,<br>
    When he plays,<br>
    All efforts from opponents go in vain,<br>
    He sprints and sprints hard with the ball,<br>
    Opponents have nothing to do but blame each other for the fault,<br>
    They can’t match his pace,<br>
    Tell me one thing!<br>
    Who will however dare to stop the blaze?<br>
    Opponents are dazed by his game,<br>
    They say him unreal,<br>
    Hard work, dedication and passion for the game has made him more fierce<br>
    His games are always treat to watch,<br>
    Oh! Don’t go on his looks<br>
    His looks are such that make girls blush<br>
    CR7 is a perfect blend of.....<br>
    I find it difficult to use the right words<br>
    The man is self-made my folks<br>
    One of the greats to play the beautiful game of football<br>
    Stop comparing him with Leo Messi and making unnecessary fuss<br>
    CR7 and Leo Messi, both, are self-made, greats of the game, after all!</p>
